## What an NLPer wishes (and does) when permeating a Translation Department

{{ partial "fontawesome.html" "github" }} 
*Summary*
Even if conceived in the intersection of linguistics and computing science,
natural language processing (NLP) has slowly turned into a more computational
and less linguistic field. Whereas computing science curricula often include NLP
(even if inside of a more general machine learning or artificial intelligence
course), linguistics and translation curricula often reach topics such as corpus
linguistics or computational terminology management only. In most cases,
software is perceived as an out-of-the box tool.

In this seminar, I discuss the ongoing integration of computing scientists in a
translation and interpreting department. I will overview the contents of the
computational linguistics course, as well as some of the research produced by
the students so far: (i) models to identify emotions in lyrics, (ii) experiments
to study the specifics of different characters of a theatre play in English and
its translation in Italian, and (iii) models to identify misogyny and
aggressiveness in tweets. I will close with a punctual overview of other
research on diverse topics, such as propaganda identification and the use of
cognates to make texts in foreign languages understandable.
