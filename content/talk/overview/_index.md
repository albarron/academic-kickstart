{{< fa calendar>}} **October, 2022**

**Abstract**
The Internet is plagued with contents that go from hate speech to 
disinformation, from propagaganda to scam, to mention just some of them. In this 
seminar I talk about some of our efforts to spot some of them, under the main 
premise that, if they turn evident, their effect on the user get dimmed. The 
talk will start talking about the identification of propaganda in text (news, 
tweets, email) and will head towards the identification of hate speech both in 
text and memes. 

**THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION. I WILL FIND THE TIME SOMEWHEN TO UPLOAD MANY 
MORE TALKS I HAVE OFFERED (RATHER THAN KEEPING THIS 2-YEAR HOLE)**

**Summary**
Even if conceived in the intersection of linguistics and computing science,
natural language processing (NLP) has turned into a more computational than 
a linguistic field. Whereas computing science curricula often include NLP,
linguistics and translation curricula usually do not. In many cases, software 
is perceived as an out-of-the box tool.

In this seminar, I discuss the ongoing integration of computing scientists in a
translation and interpreting department. I will overview the contents of the
[{{< fa link>}} computational linguistics course]({{< ref "teaching/computational-linguistics/">}}), 
as well as some of the students' research so far: 
(i) [{{< fa file-pdf >}} emotion identification in lyrics](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2769/paper_58.pdf) ,
(ii) [{{< fa file-pdf >}} a stylistic study of theatre characters in English and Italian](https://github.com/albarron/academic-kickstart/raw/master/files/coli/projects2020/dit_coli2020_project_galletti.pdf), and 
(iii) [{{< fa file-pdf >}}misogyny and aggressiveness identification in tweets](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2765/paper117.pdf). 
I will close with a punctual overview of research on other topics, such as propaganda identification and the use of cognates to make texts in foreign languages understandable.
