**Summary**
Even if conceived in the intersection of linguistics and computing science,
natural language processing (NLP) has turned into a more computational than 
a linguistic field. Whereas computing science curricula often include NLP,
linguistics and translation curricula usually do not. In many cases, software 
is perceived as an out-of-the box tool.

In this seminar, I discuss the ongoing integration of computing scientists in a
translation and interpreting department. I will overview the contents of the
[{{< fa link>}} computational linguistics course]({{< ref "teaching/computational-linguistics/">}}), 
as well as some of the students' research so far: 
(i) [{{< fa file-pdf >}} emotion identification in lyrics](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2769/paper_58.pdf) ,
(ii) [{{< fa file-pdf >}} a stylistic study of theatre characters in English and Italian](https://github.com/albarron/academic-kickstart/raw/master/files/coli/projects2020/dit_coli2020_project_galletti.pdf), and 
(iii) [{{< fa file-pdf >}}misogyny and aggressiveness identification in tweets](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2765/paper117.pdf). 
I will close with a punctual overview of research on other topics, such as propaganda identification and the use of cognates to make texts in foreign languages understandable.
