I am Associate Professor at [Università di Bologna](https://dit.unibo.it) since 
2022 (after three years as Senior assistant professor; RTDb, in the Italian 
system). I have been working on the (cross-language) assessment of 
text looking at different aspects such as originality (e.g., plagiarism 
detection) and intent (e.g., propaganda, hate speech).

Visit my [UniBO website](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.barron) for university 
matters.

Before landing at [UniBO](https://dit.unibo.it), I spent 5 years as a Scientist 
at the Languuage Technologies group of [QCRI](http://www.qcri.org) and 2 as 
research fellow at 
[TALP](http://www.talp.upc.edu/).
