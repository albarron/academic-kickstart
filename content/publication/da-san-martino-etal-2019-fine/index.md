abstract: 'Propaganda aims at influencing people′s mindset with the purpose of advancing
  a specific agenda. Previous work has addressed propaganda detection at document
  level, typically labelling all articles from a propagandistic news outlet as propaganda.
  Such noisy gold labels inevitably affect the quality of any learning system trained
  on them. A further issue with most existing systems is the lack of explainability.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel task: performing fine-grained
  analysis of texts by detecting all fragments that contain propaganda techniques
  as well as their type. In particular, we create a corpus of news articles manually
  annotated at fragment level with eighteen propaganda techniques and propose a suitable
  evaluation measure. We further design a novel multi-granularity neural network,
  and we show that it outperforms several strong BERT-based baselines.'
