abstract: We describe the fourth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2021 Cross-Language
  Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting various tasks related
  to factuality, and it is offered in Arabic, Bulgarian, English, and Spanish. Task
  1 asks to predict which tweets in a Twitter stream are worth fact-checking (focusing
  on COVID-19). Task 2 asks to determine whether a claim in a tweet can be verified
  using a set of previously fact-checked claims. Task 3 asks to predict the veracity
  of a target news article and its topical domain. The evaluation is carried out using
  mean average precision or precision at rank k for the ranking tasks, and F1 for
  the classification tasks.
