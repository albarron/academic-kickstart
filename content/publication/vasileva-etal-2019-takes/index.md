abstract: We propose a multi-task deep-learning approach for estimating the check-worthiness
  of claims in political debates. Given a political debate, such as the 2016 US Presidential
  and Vice-Presidential ones, the task is to predict which statements in the debate
  should be prioritized for fact-checking. While different fact-checking organizations
  would naturally make different choices when analyzing the same debate, we show that
  it pays to learn from multiple sources simultaneously (PolitiFact, FactCheck, ABC,
  CNN, NPR, NYT, Chicago Tribune, The Guardian, and Washington Post) in a multi-task
  learning setup, even when a particular source is chosen as a target to imitate.
  Our evaluation shows state-of-the-art results on a standard dataset for the task
  of check-worthiness prediction.
