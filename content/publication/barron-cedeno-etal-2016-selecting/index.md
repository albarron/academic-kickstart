abstract: 'Community question answering (cQA) websites are focused on users who query
  questions onto an online forum, expecting for other users to provide them answers
  or suggestions. Unlike other social media, the length of the posted queries has
  no limits and queries tend to be multi-sentence elaborations combining context,
  actual questions, and irrelevant information. We approach the problem of question
  ranking: given a user′s new question, to retrieve those previously-posted questions
  which could be equivalent, or highly relevant. This could prevent the posting of
  nearly-duplicate questions and provide the user with instantaneous answers. For
  the first time in cQA, we address the selection of relevant text ---both at sentence-
  and at constituent-level--- for parse tree-based representations. Our supervised
  models for text selection boost the performance of a tree kernel-based machine learning
  model, allowing it to overtake the current state of the art on a recently released
  cQA evaluation framework.'
