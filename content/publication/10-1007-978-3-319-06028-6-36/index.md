abstract: 'Wikipedia has been used as a source of comparable texts for a range of
  tasks, such as Statistical Machine Translation and Cross-Language Information Retrieval.
  Articles written in different languages on the same topic are often connected through
  inter-language-links. However, the extent to which these articles are similar is
  highly variable and this may impact on the use of Wikipedia as a comparable resource.
  In this paper we compare various language-independent methods for measuring cross-lingual
  similarity: character n-grams, cognateness, word count ratio, and an approach based
  on outlinks. These approaches are compared against a baseline utilising MT resources.
  Measures are also compared to human judgements of similarity using a manually created
  resource containing 700 pairs of Wikipedia articles (in 7 language pairs). Results
  indicate that a combination of language-independent models (char-n-grams, outlinks
  and word-count ratio) is highly effective for identifying cross-lingual similarity
  and performs comparably to language-dependent models (translation and monolingual
  analysis).'
