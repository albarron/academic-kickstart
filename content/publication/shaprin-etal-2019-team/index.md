abstract: We describe the system submitted by the Jack Ryder team to SemEval-2019
  Task 4 on Hyperpartisan News Detection. The task asked participants to predict whether
  a given article is hyperpartisan, i.e., extreme-left or extreme-right. We proposed
  an approach based on BERT with fine-tuning, which was ranked 7th out 28 teams on
  the distantly supervised dataset, where all articles from a hyperpartisan/non-hyperpartisan
  news outlet are considered to be hyperpartisan/non-hyperpartisan. On a manually
  annotated test dataset, where human annotators double-checked the labels, we were
  ranked 29th out of 42 teams.
