abstract: "We present an overview of the second edition of the CheckThat! Lab at CLEF\
  \ 2019. The lab featured two tasks in two different languages: English and Arabic.\
  \ Task 1 (English) challenged the participating systems to predict which claims\
  \ in a political debate or speech should be prioritized for fact-checking.  2 (Arabic)\
  \ asked to (A) rank a given set of Web pages with respect to a check-worthy claim\
  \ based on their usefulness for fact-checking that claim, (B) classify these same\
  \ Web pages according to their degree of usefulness for fact-checking the target\
  \ claim, (C) identify useful passages from these pages, and (D) use the useful pages\
  \ to predict the claim's factuality. CheckThat! provided a full evaluation framework,\
  \ consisting of data in English (derived from fact-checking sources) and Arabic\
  \ (gathered and annotated from scratch) and evaluation based on mean average precision\
  \ (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) for ranking, and F1for\
  \ classification. A total of 47 teams registered to participate in this lab, and\
  \ fourteen of them actually submitted runs (compared to nine last year). The evaluation\
  \ results show that the most successful approaches to Task 1 used various neural\
  \ networks and logistic regression. As for Task 2, learning-to-rank was used by\
  \ the highest scoring runs for subtask A, while different classifiers were used\
  \ in the other subtasks. We release to the research community all datasets from\
  \ the lab as well as the evaluation scripts, which should enable further research\
  \ in the important tasks of check-worthiness estimation and automatic claim verification."
