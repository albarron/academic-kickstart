abstract: The paper presents an approach for constructing a weighted bilingual dictionary
  of inflectional forms using as input data a traditional bilingual dictionary, and
  not parallel corpora. An algorithm is developed that generates all possible morphological
  (inflectional) forms and weights them using information on distribution of corresponding
  grammar sets (grammar information) in large corpora for each language. The algorithm
  also takes into account the compatibility of grammar sets in a language pair; for
  example, verb in past tense in language L normally is expected to be translated
  by verb in past tense in Language L'. We consider that the developed method is universal,
  i.e. can be applied to any pair of languages. The obtained dictionary is freely
  available. It can be used in several NLP tasks, for example, statistical machine
  translation.
