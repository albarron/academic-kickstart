abstract: We describe our submission to SemEval-2019 Task 4 on Hyperpartisan News
  Detection. We rely on a variety of engineered features originally used to detect
  propaganda. This is based on the assumption that biased messages are propagandistic
  and promote a particular political cause or viewpoint. In particular, we trained
  a logistic regression model with features ranging from simple bag of words to vocabulary
  richness and text readability. Our system achieved 72.9% accuracy on the manually
  annotated testset, and 60.8% on the test data that was obtained with distant supervision.
  Additional experiments showed that significant performance gains can be achieved
  with better feature pre-processing.
