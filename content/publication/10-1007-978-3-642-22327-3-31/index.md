abstract: 'Internet has made available huge amounts of information, also source code.
  Source code repositories and, in general, programming related websites, facilitate
  its reuse. In this work, we propose a simple approach to the detection of cross-language
  source code reuse, a nearly investigated problem. Our preliminary experiments, based
  on character n-grams comparison, show that considering different sections of the
  code (i.e., comments, code, reserved words, etc.), leads to different results. When
  considering three programming languages: C+þinspace+, Java, and Python, the best
  result is obtained when comments are discarded and the entire source code is considered.'
