abstract: 'We study the problem of automatic fact-checking, paying special attention
  to the impact of contextual and discourse information. We address two related tasks:
  (i) detecting check-worthy claims and (ii) fact-checking claims. We develop supervised
  systems based on neural networks, kernel-based support vector machines, and combinations
  thereof, which make use of rich input representations in terms of discourse cues
  and contextual features. For the check-worthiness estimation task, we focus on political
  debates, and we model the target claim in the context of the full intervention of
  a participant and the previous and following turns in the debate, taking into account
  contextual meta information. For the fact-checking task, we focus on answer verification
  in a community forum, and we model the veracity of the answer with respect to the
  entire question–answer thread in which it occurs as well as with respect to other
  related posts from the entire forum. We develop annotated datasets for both tasks
  and we run extensive experimental evaluation, confirming that both types of information—but
  especially contextual features—play an important role.'
