abstract: We present ClaimRank, an online system for detecting check-worthy claims.
  While originally trained on political debates, the system can work for any kind
  of text, e.g., interviews or just regular news articles. Its aim is to facilitate
  manual fact-checking efforts by prioritizing the claims that fact-checkers should
  consider first. ClaimRank supports both Arabic and English, it is trained on actual
  annotations from nine reputable fact-checking organizations (PolitiFact, FactCheck,
  ABC, CNN, NPR, NYT, Chicago Tribune, The Guardian, and Washington Post), and thus
  it can mimic the claim selection strategies for each and any of them, as well as
  for the union of them all.
