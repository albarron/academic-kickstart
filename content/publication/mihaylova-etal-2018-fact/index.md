abstract: 'Community Question Answering (cQA) forums are very popular nowadays, as
  they represent effective means for communities around particular topics to share
  information. Unfortunately, this information is not always factual. Thus, here we
  explore a new dimension in the context of cQA, which has been ignored so far: checking
  the veracity of answers to particular questions in cQA forums. As this is a new
  problem, we create a specialized dataset for it. We further propose a novel multi-faceted
  model, which captures information from the answer content (what is said and how),
  from the author profile (who says it), from the rest of the community forum (where
  it is said), and from external authoritative sources of information (external support).
  Evaluation results show a MAP value of 86.54, which is 21 points absolute above
  the baseline.'
