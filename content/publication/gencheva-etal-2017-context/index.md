abstract: 'In the context of investigative journalism, we address the problem of automatically
  identifying which claims in a given document are most worthy and should be prioritized
  for fact-checking. Despite its importance, this is a relatively understudied problem.
  Thus, we create a new corpus of political debates, containing statements that have
  been fact-checked by nine reputable sources, and we train machine learning models
  to predict which claims should be prioritized for fact-checking, i.e., we model
  the problem as a ranking task. Unlike previous work, which has looked primarily
  at sentences in isolation, in this paper we focus on a rich input representation
  modeling the context: relationship between the target statement and the larger context
  of the debate, interaction between the opponents, and reaction by the moderator
  and by the public. Our experiments show state-of-the-art results, outperforming
  a strong rivaling system by a margin, while also confirming the importance of the
  contextual information.'
