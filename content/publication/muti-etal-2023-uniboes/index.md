abstract: 'We present our submission to SemEval-2023 Task 10: Explainable Detection
  of Online Sexism (EDOS). We address all three tasks: Task A consists of identifying
  whether a post is sexist. If so, Task B attempts to assign it one of four categories:
  threats, derogation, animosity, and prejudiced discussions. Task C aims for an even
  more fine-grained classification, divided among 11 classes. Our team UniBoe′s experiments
  with fine-tuning of hate-tuned Transformer-based models and priming for generative
  models. In addition, we explore model-agnostic strategies, such as data augmentation
  techniques combined with active learning, as well as obfuscation of identity terms.
  Our official submissions obtain an F1_score of 0.83 for Task A, 0.58 for Task B
  and 0.32 for Task C.'
