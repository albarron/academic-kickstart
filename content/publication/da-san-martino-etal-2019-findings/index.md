abstract: We present the shared task on Fine-Grained Propaganda Detection, which was
  organized as part of the NLP4IF workshop at EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. There were two subtasks.
  FLC is a fragment-level task that asks for the identification of propagandist text
  fragments in a news article and also for the prediction of the specific propaganda
  technique used in each such fragment (18-way classification task). SLC is a sentence-level
  binary classification task asking to detect the sentences that contain propaganda.
  A total of 12 teams submitted systems for the FLC task, 25 teams did so for the
  SLC task, and 14 teams eventually submitted a system description paper. For both
  subtasks, most systems managed to beat the baseline by a sizable margin. The leaderboard
  and the data from the competition are available at http://propaganda.qcri.org/nlp4if-shared-task/.
