 abstract = {The fifth edition of the CheckThat! Lab is held as part of the 2022 Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting various factuality tasks in seven languages: Arabic, Bulgarian, Dutch, English, German, Spanish, and Turkish. Task 1 focuses on disinformation related to the ongoing COVID-19 infodemic and politics, and asks to predict whether a tweet is worth fact-checking, contains a verifiable factual claim, is harmful to the society, or is of interest to policy makers and why. Task 2 asks to retrieve claims that have been previously fact-checked and that could be useful to verify the claim in a tweet. Task 3 is to predict the veracity of a news article. Tasks 1 and 3 are classification problems, while Task 2 is a ranking one.},
