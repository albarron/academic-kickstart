 abstract = {We present proppy, the first publicly available real-world, real-time propaganda detection system for online news, which aims at raising awareness, thus potentially limiting the impact of propaganda and helping fight disinformation. The system constantly monitors a number of news sources, deduplicates and clusters the news into events, and organizes the articles about an event on the basis of the likelihood that they contain propagandistic content. The system is trained on known propaganda sources using a variety of stylistic features. The evaluation results on a standard dataset show stateof-the-art results for propaganda detection.},
