abstract: We present proppy, the first publicly available real-world, real-time propaganda
  detection system for online news, which aims at raising awareness, thus potentially
  limiting the impact of propaganda and helping fight disinformation. The system constantly
  monitors a number of news sources, deduplicates and clusters the news into events,
  and organizes the articles about an event on the basis of the likelihood that they
  contain propagandistic content. The system is trained on known propaganda sources
  using a variety of stylistic features. The evaluation results on a standard dataset
  show stateof-the-art results for propaganda detection.
