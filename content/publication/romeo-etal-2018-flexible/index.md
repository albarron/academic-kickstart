abstract: Although deep neural networks have been proving to be excellent tools to
  deliver state-of-the-art results, when data is scarce and the tackled tasks involve
  complex semantic inference, deep linguistic processing and traditional structure-based
  approaches, such as tree kernel methods, are an alternative solution. Community
  Question Answering is a research area that benefits from deep linguistic analysis
  to improve the experience of the community of forum users. In this paper, we present
  a UIMA framework to distribute the computation of cQA tasks over computer clusters
  such that traditional systems can scale to large datasets and deliver fast processing.
