abstract: 'Three reasons make plagiarism across languages to be on the rise: (i) speakers
  of under-resourced languages often consult documentation in a foreign language,
  (ii) people immersed in a foreign country can still consult material written in
  their native language, and (iii) people are often interested in writing in a language
  different to their native one. Most efforts for automatically detecting cross-language
  plagiarism depend on a preliminary translation, which is not always available. In
  this paper we propose a freely available architecture for plagiarism detection across
  languages covering the entire process: heuristic retrieval, detailed analysis, and
  post-processing. On top of this architecture we explore the suitability of three
  cross-language similarity estimation models: Cross-Language Alignment-based Similarity
  Analysis (CL-ASA), Cross-Language Character n-Grams (CL-CNG), and Translation plus
  Monolingual Analysis (T+MA); three inherently different models in nature and required
  resources. The three models are tested extensively under the same conditions on
  the different plagiarism detection sub-tasks—something never done before. The experiments
  show that T+MA produces the best results, closely followed by CL-ASA. Still CL-ASA
  obtains higher values of precision, an important factor in plagiarism detection
  when lesser user intervention is desired.'
