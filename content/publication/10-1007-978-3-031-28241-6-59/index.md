abstract: 'The five editions of the CheckThat! lab so far have focused on the main
  tasks of the information verification pipeline: check-worthiness, evidence retrieval
  and pairing, and verification. The 2023 edition of the lab zooms into some of the
  problems and---for the first time---it offers five tasks in seven languages (Arabic,
  Dutch, English, German, Italian, Spanish, and Turkish): Task 1 asks to determine
  whether an item, text or a text plus an image, is check-worthy; Task 2 requires
  to assess whether a text snippet is subjective or not; Task 3 looks for estimating
  the political bias of a document or a news outlet; Task 4 requires to determine
  the level of factuality of a document or a news outlet; and Task 5 is about identifying
  authorities that should be trusted to verify a contended claim.'
