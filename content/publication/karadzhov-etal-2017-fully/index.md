abstract: 'Given the constantly growing proliferation of false claims online in recent
  years, there has been also a growing research interest in automatically distinguishing
  false rumors from factually true claims. Here, we propose a general-purpose framework
  for fully-automatic fact checking using external sources, tapping the potential
  of the entire Web as a knowledge source to confirm or reject a claim. Our framework
  uses a deep neural network with LSTM text encoding to combine semantic kernels with
  task-specific embeddings that encode a claim together with pieces of potentially
  relevant text fragments from the Web, taking the source reliability into account.
  The evaluation results show good performance on two different tasks and datasets:
  (i) rumor detection and (ii) fact checking of the answers to a question in community
  question answering forums.'
