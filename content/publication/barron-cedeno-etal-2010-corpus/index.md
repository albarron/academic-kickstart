abstract: 'The simple access to texts on digital libraries and the World Wide Web
  has led to an increased number of plagiarism cases in recent years, which renders
  manual plagiarism detection infeasible at large. Various methods for automatic plagiarism
  detection have been developed whose objective is to assist human experts in the
  analysis of documents for plagiarism. The methods can be divided into two main approaches:
  intrinsic and external. Unlike other tasks in natural language processing and information
  retrieval, it is not possible to publish a collection of real plagiarism cases for
  evaluation purposes since they cannot be properly anonymized. Therefore, current
  evaluations found in the literature are incomparable and, very often not even reproducible.
  Our contribution in this respect is a newly developed large-scale corpus of artificial
  plagiarism useful for the evaluation of intrinsic as well as external plagiarism
  detection. Additionally, new detection performance measures tailored to the evaluation
  of plagiarism detection algorithms are proposed.'
