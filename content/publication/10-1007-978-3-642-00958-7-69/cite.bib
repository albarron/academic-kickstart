 abstract = {When automatic plagiarism detection is carried out considering a reference corpus, a suspicious text is compared to a set of original documents in order to relate the plagiarised text fragments to their potential source. One of the biggest difficulties in this task is to locate plagiarised fragments that have been modified (by rewording, insertion or deletion, for example) from the source text.},
