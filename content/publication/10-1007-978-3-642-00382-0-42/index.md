abstract: Automatic plagiarism detection considering a reference corpus compares a
  suspicious text to a set of original documents in order to relate the plagiarised
  fragments to their potential source. Publications on this task often assume that
  the search space (the set of reference documents) is a narrow set where any search
  strategy will produce a good output in a short time. However, this is not always
  true. Reference corpora are often composed of a big set of original documents where
  a simple exhaustive search strategy becomes practically impossible.
