abstract: The C-value/NC-value algorithm, a hybrid approach to automatic term recognition,
  has been originally developed to extract multiword term candidates from specialised
  documents written in English. Here, we present three main modifications to this
  algorithm that affect how the obtained output is refined. The first modification
  aims to maximise the number of real terms in the list of candidates with a new approach
  for the stop-list application process. The second modification adapts the C-value
  calculation formula in order to consider single word terms. The third modification
  changes how the term candidates are grouped, exploiting a lemmatised version of
  the input corpus. Additionally, size of candidate's context window is variable.
  We also show the necessary linguistic modifications to apply this algorithm to the
  recognition of term candidates in Spanish.
