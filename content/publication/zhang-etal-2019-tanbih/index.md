abstract: We introduce Tanbih, a news aggregator with intelligent analysis tools to
  help readers understanding what′s behind a news story. Our system displays news
  grouped into events and generates media profiles that show the general factuality
  of reporting, the degree of propagandistic content, hyper-partisanship, leading
  political ideology, general frame of reporting, and stance with respect to various
  claims and topics of a news outlet. In addition, we automatically analyse each article
  to detect whether it is propagandistic and to determine its stance with respect
  to a number of controversial topics.
