abstract: Propaganda is a mechanism to influence public opinion, which is inherently
  present in extremely biased and fake news. Here, we propose a model to automatically
  assess the level of propagandistic content in an article based on different representations,
  from writing style and readability level to the presence of certain keywords. We
  experiment thoroughly with different variations of such a model on a new publicly
  available corpus, and we show that character n-grams and other style features outperform
  existing alternatives to identify propaganda based on word n-grams. Unlike previous
  work, we make sure that the test data comes from news sources that were unseen on
  training, thus penalizing learning algorithms that model the news sources used at
  training time as opposed to solving the actual task. We integrate our supervised
  model in a public website, which organizes recent articles covering the same event
  on the basis of their propagandistic contents. This allows users to quickly explore
  different perspectives of the same story, and it also enables investigative journalists
  to dig further into how different media use stories and propaganda to pursue their
  agenda.
