abstract: 'In this digital era, people rely on the internet for their news consumption.
  As people are free to express their opinions on social media, much information shared
  on the internet is loaded with propaganda. Propagandist contents are intended to
  influence public opinion. In the mainstream media or prominent news agencies, the
  authors&rsquo; and news agencies&rsquo; own bias may impact in the news contents.
  Hence, it is required to detect such propaganda spread through news articles. Detection
  and classification of propagandist text require standard, high-quality, annotated
  datasets. A few datasets are available for propaganda classification. However, these
  datasets are mostly in English. Hindi is the most spoken language in India, and
  efforts are needed to detect its propagandist contents. This research work introduces
  two new datasets: H-Prop and H-Prop-News, which consist of news articles in Hindi
  annotated as propaganda or non-propaganda. The H-Prop dataset is generated by translating
  28,630 news articles from the QProp dataset. The H-Prop-News dataset contains 5500
  news articles collected from 32 prominent Hindi news websites. We experiment with
  the proposed datasets using four supervised machine learning models combined with
  different feature vectors and word embeddings. Our experiments achieve 87% accuracy
  using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature vectors. The datasets provide high-quality
  labeled news articles in Hindi and open new avenues for researchers to explore techniques
  for analyzing and classifying propaganda in Hindi text.'
