abstract: This work addresses the issue of cross-language high similarity and near-duplicates
  search, where, for the given document, a highly similar one is to be identified
  from a large cross-language collection of documents. We propose a concept-based
  similarity model for the problem which is very light in computation and memory.
  We evaluate the model on three corpora of different nature and two language pairs
  English-German and English-Spanish using the Eurovoc conceptual thesaurus. Our model
  is compared with two state-of-the-art models and we find, though the proposed model
  is very generic, it produces competitive results and is significantly stable and
  consistent across the corpora.
