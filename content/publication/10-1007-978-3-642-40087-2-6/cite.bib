 abstract = {The development of models for automatic detection of text re-use and plagiarism across languages has received increasing attention in recent years. However, the lack of an evaluation framework composed of annotated datasets has caused these efforts to be isolated. In this paper we present the CL!TR 2011 corpus, the first manually created corpus for the analysis of cross-language text re-use between English and Hindi. The corpus was used during the Cross-Language !ndian Text Re-Use Detection Competition. Here we overview the approaches applied the contestants and evaluate their quality when detecting a re-used text together with its source.},
