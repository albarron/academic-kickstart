abstract: The development of models for automatic detection of text re-use and plagiarism
  across languages has received increasing attention in recent years. However, the
  lack of an evaluation framework composed of annotated datasets has caused these
  efforts to be isolated. In this paper we present the CL!TR 2011 corpus, the first
  manually created corpus for the analysis of cross-language text re-use between English
  and Hindi. The corpus was used during the Cross-Language !ndian Text Re-Use Detection
  Competition. Here we overview the approaches applied the contestants and evaluate
  their quality when detecting a re-used text together with its source.
