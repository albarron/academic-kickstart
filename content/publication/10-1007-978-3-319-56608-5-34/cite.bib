 abstract = {In example-based retrieval a system is queried with a document aiming to retrieve other similar or relevant documents. We address an instance of this problem: question retrieval in community Question Answering (cQA) forums. In this scenario, both the document collection and the queries are relatively short multi-sentence documents subject to noise and redundancy, which makes it harder for learning-to-rank algorithms to build upon the proper text representation.},
