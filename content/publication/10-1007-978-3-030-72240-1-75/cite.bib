 abstract = {We describe the fourth edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2021 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). The lab evaluates technology supporting various tasks related to factuality, and it is offered in Arabic, Bulgarian, English, and Spanish. Task 1 asks to predict which tweets in a Twitter stream are worth fact-checking (focusing on COVID-19). Task 2 asks to determine whether a claim in a tweet can be verified using a set of previously fact-checked claims. Task 3 asks to predict the veracity of a target news article and its topical domain. The evaluation is carried out using mean average precision or precision at rank k for the ranking tasks, and F1 for the classification tasks.},
