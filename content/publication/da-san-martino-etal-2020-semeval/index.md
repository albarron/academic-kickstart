abstract: 'We present the results and the main findings of SemEval-2020 Task 11 on
  Detection of Propaganda Techniques in News Articles. The task featured two subtasks.
  Subtask SI is about Span Identification: given a plain-text document, spot the specific
  text fragments containing propaganda. Subtask TC is about Technique Classification:
  given a specific text fragment, in the context of a full document, determine the
  propaganda technique it uses, choosing from an inventory of 14 possible propaganda
  techniques. The task attracted a large number of participants: 250 teams signed
  up to participate and 44 made a submission on the test set. In this paper, we present
  the task, analyze the results, and discuss the system submissions and the methods
  they used. For both subtasks, the best systems used pre-trained Transformers and
  ensembles.'
