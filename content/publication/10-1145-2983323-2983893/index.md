abstract: 'We study the impact of different types of features for question ranking
  in community Question Answering: bag-of-words models (BoW), syntactic tree kernels
  (TKs) and rank features. It should be noted that structural kernels have never been
  applied to the question reranking task, i.e., question to question similarity, where
  they have to model paraphrase relations. Additionally, the informal text, typically
  present in forums, poses new challenges to the use of TKs. We compare our learning
  to rank (L2R) algorithms against a strong baseline given by the Google rank (GR).
  The results show that (i) our shallow structures used in TKs are robust enough to
  noisy data and (ii) improving GR requires effective BoW features and TKs along with
  an accurate model of GR features in the used L2R algorithm.'
