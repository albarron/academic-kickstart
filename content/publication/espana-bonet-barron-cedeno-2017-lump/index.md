abstract: 'This is the Lump team participation at SemEval 2017 Task 1 on Semantic
  Textual Similarity. Our supervised model relies on features which are multilingual
  or interlingual in nature. We include lexical similarities, cross-language explicit
  semantic analysis, internal representations of multilingual neural networks and
  interlingual word embeddings. Our representations allow to use large datasets in
  language pairs with many instances to better classify instances in smaller language
  pairs avoiding the necessity of translating into a single language. Hence we can
  deal with all the languages in the task: Arabic, English, Spanish, and Turkish.'
