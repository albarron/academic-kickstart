abstract: 'The Fourth International Workshop on Uncovering Plagiarism, Authorship,
  and Social Software Misuse (PAN10) was held in conjunction with the 2010 Conference
  on Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access Evaluation (CLEF-10) in Padua,
  Italy. The workshop was organized as a competition covering two tasks: plagiarism
  detection and Wikipedia vandalism detection. This report gives a short overview
  of the plagiarism detection task. Detailed analyses of both tasks have been published
  as CLEF Notebook Papers [3, 6], which can be downloaded at www.webis.de/publications.'
