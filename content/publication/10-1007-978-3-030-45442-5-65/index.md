abstract: We describe the third edition of the CheckThat! Lab, which is part of the
  2020 Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). CheckThat! proposes four complementary
  tasks and a related task from previous lab editions, offered in English, Arabic,
  and Spanish. Task 1 asks to predict which tweets in a Twitter stream are worth fact-checking.
  Task 2 asks to determine whether a claim posted in a tweet can be verified using
  a set of previously fact-checked claims. Task 3 asks to retrieve text snippets from
  a given set of Web pages that would be useful for verifying a target tweet's claim.
  Task 4 asks to predict the veracity of a target tweet's claim using a set of potentially-relevant
  Web pages. Finally, the lab offers a fifth task that asks to predict the check-worthiness
  of the claims made in English political debates and speeches. CheckThat! features
  a full evaluation framework. The evaluation is carried out using mean average precision
  or precision at rank k for ranking tasks, and F1 for classification tasks.
