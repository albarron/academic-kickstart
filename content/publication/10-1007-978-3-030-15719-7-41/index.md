abstract: 'We introduce the second edition of the CheckThat! Lab, part of the 2019
  Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF). CheckThat! proposes two complementary tasks.
  Task 1: predict which claims in a political debate should be prioritized for fact-checking.
  Task 2: rank Web-retrieved pages against a check-worthy claim based on their usefulness
  for fact-checking, extract useful passages from those pages, and then use them all
  to decide whether the claim is factually true or false. Checkthat! provides a full
  evaluation framework, consisting of data in English (derived from fact-checking
  sources) and Arabic (gathered and annotated from scratch) and evaluation based on
  mean average precision (MAP) for ranking and F$$_1$$1for classification tasks.'
