## Prerequisites

### A gentle introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org/) {#topic0}
* This topic **wont be covered in class**. It was offered to the DIT community [earlier this year](https://github.com/TinfFoil/learning_dit_python).  
* You did not attend? All contents (slides, notebooks, 2021 video recordings) are [here](https://github.com/TinfFoil/learning_dit_python).
* Either you attended or not, I suggest you to **do all the exercises before the third session**.

## Projects

The [evaluation](#evaluation) is based on a project. Look for inspiration, in the [projects presented in previous years](#coli_projects)

### Some project ideas

Whereas you are supposed to apply the acquired knowledge on a problem of your own interest, here are some ideas, in case you find yourself lost

<!---
* Performing a small research project taking advantage of the COVID-19 corpus (see Beyond the course)
--> 
#### _Standard_ research


* Performing research on propaganda identification in other languages than English. For inspiration, see this [IPM paper](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065627668&origin=inward&txGid=9caa756c9a67cff1f3ae84fa6a79bfd2), this [EMNLP paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1565/), or this [SemEval shared task](https://propaganda.qcri.org/semeval2020-task11/index.html)
* Estimating the complexity of a text for a non-native speaker. For inspiration, see [READ-IT](http://www.italianlp.it/demo/read-it/)
* Analysing the quality of Wikipedia articles across languages

#### Shared Tasks (to be updated)

* The [ADoBO shared task](https://adobo-task.github.io) on automatic detection of borrowings (deadline: 17th May 2021).
* The [FakeDeS fake news detection challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/fakedes/home) (in Spanish): (deadline: 30th April 2021).
* Some of the problems proposed in [EVALITA 2020](http://www.evalita.it/2020/tasks). There is [age and gender profiling](https://sites.google.com/view/tag-it-2020), [misogyny identification](https://amievalita2020.github.io/), and  [complexity evaluation](https://sites.google.com/view/accompl-it/home-page?authuser=0), among many others.
<!---
**Are you defending on the first/second appello**? Why not turning your project into a [CLIC-it](http://clic2020.ilc.cnr.it/en/home-2/) paper? The deadline is on 15/07/2020.

## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students is expected. Assuming you know the basics of programming (e.g., by completing the python course in [Topic 0](#topic0)) we will cover a (practical) description of diverse models and tasks.



## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The student will work on addressing a problem within her **own research** interests with the knowledge acquired during the course. Upon agreement of the topic, the student will work on solving the problem and will produce a written report.

**_The final evaluation will be computed as a combination of both report and the oral exam around it._**

### Important points

* Your project should be submitted **1 week before the appello** to be considered valid.
* Do you want to target **30L**? Conference quality is a good way (but it is not the only one!. Talk to me well in advance if you aim this, as it would require my own heavy commitment to reach the necessary quality.

## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with jupyter notebooks. Continuous exercises will be carried out.

## Office hours

See my [UniBO website](https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.barron)
