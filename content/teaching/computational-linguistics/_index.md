## <a id="projects"></a>Projects

The [evaluation](#evaluation) is based on a project. Look for inspiration, in the [projects presented in previous years](#coli_projects)

### Some project ideas

Whereas you are supposed to apply the acquired knowledge on a problem of your own interest, here are some ideas, in case you find yourself lost

<!---
* Performing a small research project taking advantage of the COVID-19 corpus (see Beyond the course)
--> 

#### Hate Speech

1. **Sarcasm identification in implicit misogyny**

    This project consists of four main tasks. (a) Train a model for implicit hate speech identification using the the [corpus from ElSherief et al.](https://github.com/gt-salt/implicit-hate). (b) Train a model on a sarcasm/humour using (for instance) this [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/humor-detection/data). (c) Apply both resulting models to the [AMI 2018 dataset](https://amievalita2018.wordpress.com/)  (d) Analyse whether the AMI dataset contains cases of both implicit misogyny and/or sarcasm/humour.
2. **Dataset detective: where does this instance come from?**

    In this project, you will train a model to try to identify the dataset an instance comes from rather than the actual task it is intended to. 
    (a) Train and evaluate  one-vs-the-rest models for each of the four datasets.
    (b) Train and evaluate a multi-class model for all instances in all four datasets.
    (c) Repeat (a) and (b) but this time consider only positive (negative)
 instances    
 (d) Analyse the outcome: can you build a classifier that differentiates datasets? 
     The four datasets are on [hate speech and offensive language](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data) (2 partitions), [aggression](https://github.com/kmi-linguistics/trac-1), and [toxicity](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data).
    
#### Do not translate

1. **Identifying the L2 level for a text**

    Create a model to score the complexity/readability/comprehensibility for a student at a given L2 level. The scores are B1, B2, C1 and C2

2. **Spot definitions within Wikipedia articles in multiple languages**

    Given a Wikipedia article, spot the sentence with a definitional context. Do this in Wikipedia articles about the same topic in multiple languages.

#### Anaysis of TV series

The main object of study is medical TV dramas; in particular [Grey's Anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey%27s_Anatomy). 

Available resources: we have a manual segmentation of the audiovisual text segment=portion of video characterised by the spatio-temporal-action continuity); codifications of each segment with the kind of narrative (SP=sentimental plot, PP=professional plot, MC=medical case plot).

1. **Subtitles and audiovisual text**

    Analysing the subtitles and their relationship with the segmentation and codification of the audiovisual text.

2. **Linguistic analysis of subtitles** 

    Analysing the subtitiles (of which we lack character tags) and explore them from the linguistic point of view.

3. **Narrative identification**

    Identify the narrative line of short and long summaries from [Grey's anatomy fandom site](https://greysanatomy.fandom.com/wiki/A_Hard_Day%27s_Night) to identify the evolution of the different storylines 
 of the diverse stories.

#### Shared Tasks

1. **Text Complexity DE Challenge 2022** 

    Developing machine learning based regression models to predict the complexity of a sentence in German for German learners in the B level. More information at the [DE challenge website](https://qulab.github.io/text_complexity_challlenge/). Release of the test set on 20th June; deadline on **4th July**.

    More Germeval tasks should [come soon](https://germeval.github.io/).



2. **Irony and stereotypes spreaders**

    Given a Twitter feed in English, determine whether its author spreads Irony and Stereotypes. Input: Timelines of authors sharing Irony and Stereotypes towards, for instance, women or the LGTB community. More details at the [PAN website](https://pan.webis.de/clef22/pan22-web/author-profiling.html); deadline around **24 May**.

2. **Detection of Aggressive and Violent INCIdents from Social Media in Spanish**

    **Violent event identification**. Determine whether a given tweet is associated with a violent incident or not (binary classification). **Violent event category recognition**. Recognize the crime category (see above) to which a given tweet belongs (multi-class classification). More information at the [DA-VINCIS website](https://sites.google.com/view/davincis-iberlef/home). The test set will be released on 10th May; deadline around **21st May**.

3. **PoliticEs: Spanish Author Profiling for Political Ideology**

    Task 1: identifying political ideology from a text collection (binary). Task 2: identifying the gender and the profession as demographic traits from a set of tweets of a user . More information at the [IBERLEF 2022 website](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/1948). Test set announced for April 18th. Deadline around **May 4th**.

4. **Recommendation System, Sentiment Analysis and Covid Semaphore Prediction for Mexican Tourist Texts**

    **Recommendation system**: given a TripAdvisor tourist and a Mexican tourist place, predict the degree of satisfaction in range [1, 5] that the tourist will have when visiting that place.
    **Sentiment analysis**: given an opinion about a Mexican tourist place, determine the polarity in range [1, 5] and the type of opinion among hotel, restaurant or attraction. **Epidemiological semaphore prediction**: given the news related to covid of a Mexican region, determine the semaphore color of the weeks 0, 2, 4 and 8 in the future. More information at the [Rest-Mex 2022 website](https://sites.google.com/cicese.edu.mx/rest-mex-2022). Test set released on 13th April. Deadline around **May 4th**.

5. **sEXism Identification in Social neTworks**

    **Sexism Identification**: decide whether a tweet contains sexist expressions or behaviours. **Sexism Categorization**: once a message has been classified as sexist, categorize the message according to the type of sexism (5 classes). More information at the [EXIST 2022 website](http://nlp.uned.es/exist2022/). Test set release on 22 March; deadline on **12 April**.

6. **Many others** 

    Consider the problems proposed in [EVALITA 2020](http://www.evalita.it/2020/tasks). There is [age and gender profiling](https://sites.google.com/view/tag-it-2020), [misogyny identification](https://amievalita2020.github.io/), and  [complexity evaluation](https://sites.google.com/view/accompl-it/home-page?authuser=0).

#### _Standard_ research


* Performing research on propaganda identification in other languages than English. For inspiration, see this [IPM paper](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065627668&origin=inward&txGid=9caa756c9a67cff1f3ae84fa6a79bfd2), this [EMNLP paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1565/), or this [SemEval shared task](https://propaganda.qcri.org/semeval2020-task11/index.html)
* Estimating the complexity of a text for a non-native speaker. For inspiration, see [READ-IT](http://www.italianlp.it/demo/read-it/)
* Analysing the quality of Wikipedia articles across languages

## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students is expected. Assuming you know the basics of programming (e.g., by completing the python course in [Topic 0](#topic0)) we will cover a (practical) description of diverse models and tasks.



## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The student will work on addressing a problem within her **own research** interests with the knowledge acquired during the course. Upon agreement of the topic, the student will work on solving the problem and will produce a written report.

**_The final evaluation will be computed as a combination of both report and the oral exam around it._**

### Important points

* Your project should be submitted **1 week before the appello** to be considered valid.
* Do you want to target **30L**? Conference quality is a good way (but it is not the only one!. Talk to me well in advance if you aim this, as it would require my own heavy commitment to reach the necessary quality.

## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with jupyter notebooks. Continuous exercises will be carried out.

## Office hours
