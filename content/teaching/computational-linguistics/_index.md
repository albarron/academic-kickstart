**Academic Year 2020/2021**

## Learning outcomes

The student will learn the basic theoretical aspects of computational linguistics/natural language processing and will acquire practical skills to perform from tokenization and vectorization to the computation of similarities and supervised models (e.g., for topic identification, structural analysis, meaning analysis).

## Course contents

## Projects

The [evaluation](#evaluation) is based on a project. If you want 
some inspiration, look at the [projects presented last year](../computational-linguistics2020/#coli20_projects)

### Some project ideas

Whereas you are supposed to apply the acquired knowledge on a problem of your own interest, here are some ideas, in case you find yourself lost

<!---
* Performing a small research project taking advantage of the COVID-19 corpus (see Beyond the course)
-->
* Participating in the [ADoBO shared task](https://adobo-task.github.io) on automatic detection of borrowings.
* Addressing some of the problems proposed in [EVALITA 2020](http://www.evalita.it/2020/tasks). There is [age and gender profiling](https://sites.google.com/view/tag-it-2020), [misogyny identification](https://amievalita2020.github.io/), and  [complexity evaluation](https://sites.google.com/view/accompl-it/home-page?authuser=0), among many others.
* Participating in the [fake news detection challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/fakedes/home)
* Performing research on propaganda identification in other languages than English. For inspiration, see this [IPM paper](https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85065627668&origin=inward&txGid=9caa756c9a67cff1f3ae84fa6a79bfd2), this [EMNLP paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1565/), or this [SemEval shared task](https://propaganda.qcri.org/semeval2020-task11/index.html)
* Estimating the complexity of a text for a non-native speaker. For inspiration, see [READ-IT](http://www.italianlp.it/demo/read-it/)
* Analysing the quality of Wikipedia articles across languages

**Are you defending on the first/second appello**? Why not turning your project into a [CLIC-it](http://clic2020.ilc.cnr.it/en/home-2/) paper? The deadline is on 15/07/2020.

## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students is expected. Assuming you know the basics of programming (e.g., by completing the python course in [Topic 0](#topic0)) we will cover a (practical) description of diverse models and tasks.



## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The student will work on addressing a problem within her **own research** interests with the knowledge acquired during the course. Upon agreement of the topic, the student will work on solving the problem and will produce a written report. A poster session will be organized before at the end of the course (or before every _appello_ )in which the students will present their research work.

**_The final evaluation will be computed as a combination of both report and poster presentation._**

### Important points

* If the conditions (covid) are not favourable, we wont have a poster session. In that case, your project should be submitted **1 week before the appello** to be considered valid.
* Do you want to target **30L**? Your final project **should be submitted to a conference for publication**. Talk to me well in advance if you aim this, as it would require my heavy involvement and a high quality will be necessary.

## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with jupyter notebooks. Continuous exercises will be carried out.
