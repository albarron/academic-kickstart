## Academic Year 2019/2020

## Learning outcomes

The student will learn the basic theoretical aspects of computational linguistics/natural language processing and will acquire practical skills to perform from tokenization and vectorization to the computation of similarities and supervised models (e.g., for topic identification, structural analysis, meaning analysis).

## Course contents

Whereas the contents could be (slightly) adapted according to the students skills and interests, the general structure of the course will be as follows.

**Materials will be posted here at production time**

#### 1. Introduction to Python scripting
* Materials
* Readings
* Notebook(s)

#### 2. Word tokenization and part of speech
#### 3. Vectorization and semantic analysis
#### 4. Word vectors
#### 5. Applications

## Readings/Bibliography

### Core

* Hobson Lane, Cole Howard, Hannes Hapke (2019). Natural Language Processing in Action Understanding, analyzing, and generating text with Python. Manning Publications.
* Steven Bird, Ewan Klein, and Edward Loper. [Natural Language Processing with Python](http://www.nltk.org/book/)

### Optional

* Dan Jurafsky and James H. Martin. Speech and Language Processing (3rd ed. draft) Draft chapters in progress, October 16, 2019
* Yoav Goldberg. (2017). Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing (G. Hirst, ed.). Morgan & Claypool Publishers.
* Emily M. Bender (2013). Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies. Morgan & Claypool Publishers.
* Kenneth Ward Church. Unix for poets.

## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students is expected. We will start with an introduction to the Python programming language and follow with a (practical) description of diverse models and tasks.

Attendance to a minimum of 70% of the lessons is a must.

## Assessment methods

The student will work on addressing a problem within her **own research** interests with the knowledge acquired during the course. Upon agreement of the topic, the student will work on solving the problem and will write a written report. A poster session will be organized at the end of the course in which the students will present their research work.

**_The final evaluation will be computed as a combination of both report and poster presentation._**

## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with jupyter notebooks. Continuous exercises will be carried out.

## Office hours

TBD
