This is a crash course involving only 3 lessons. In the 2022 edition, it was 
carried out at the end of the 
[Computer-assisted Translation](https://www.unibo.it/it/didattica/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2022/470047) 
lesson. As a result, this lesson is "officially" named 33409 - Computer-assisted 
Translation from English into Italian: Practical
