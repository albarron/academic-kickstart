##   Teaching methods

The course will be a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students will be expected. The practical sessions will mostly imply translation from English into Italian. Desktop software and mobile apps will be included.

Attendance to a minimum of 70% of the lessons is a must.

## Assessment methods

The students will be evaluated on a final practical exercise. They will most likely pursue the localization of a small user interface.
