##### Some quick guides to build corpora
* A [quick guide](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/11/building-wikipedia-text-corpus-nlp.html) on constructing corpora from the Wikipedia
* [Gensim's guide](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/corpora/textcorpus.html) to build corpora with dictionaries



### Optional

# Links to diverse corpora
* A recently [released corpus](https://www.english-corpora.org/corona/) with texts on COVID-19
* A [repository](https://github.com/karthikncode/nlp-datasets) with a list of interesting corpora
* Another [list](https://nlpforhackers.io/corpora/) of interesting corpora (incl. scripts from The Simpsons)
* Yet [another list](https://devopedia.org/text-corpus-for-nlp) and discussion on what is a good corpus (with many more links to resoucces)
* Google's dataset search [website](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)


<!--## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, active participation of the students is expected. Assuming you know the basics of programming (e.g., by completing the python course in [Topic 0](#topic0)) we will cover a (practical) description of diverse models and tasks

In order to succeed, the student has to carry our regular homework, which comes in the form of small exercises.



## Evaluation {#evaluation}

The student will work on addressing a problem within her **own research** interests with the knowledge acquired during the course. Upon agreement of the topic, the student will work on solving the problem and will produce a written report.

**_The final evaluation will be computed as a combination of both report and the oral exam around it._**


### Important points

* Your project should be submitted **1 week before the appello** to be considered valid.
* Do you want to target **30L**? Conference quality is a good way (but it is not the only one!). Talk to me well in advance if you aim this, as it would require my own heavy commitment to reach the necessary quality.


## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with jupyter notebooks. Continuous exercises will be carried out.-->
