**Academic Year 2023/2024**


This is a gentle introduction to the python programming language. It is intended
for the students of DIT's [PhD in Translation, Interpreting and Intercultural 
studies](https://phd.unibo.it/traduzione-interpretazione-interculturalita/en).

The crash course consists of only 3 lessons. It intends to wake up the 
curiosity and understanding the capabilities of computing programming, in 
particular for text processing.

## Teaching methods

The course is a combination of seminar and practical sessions. In either case, 
active participation of the students is expected. 


<!--## Evaluation {#evaluation}

This lesson is not subject to formal evaluation. Students attending to at least
two out of the three sessions will obtain an extra point in the 
Computer-assisted Translation lesson.-->

## Teaching tools

Seminars will be carried out with slides and coding will be carried out with 
jupyter notebooks.
